I. Problem Description and Project Goal.
The problem at hand involves the development of software for the United States Census Bureau, specifically for the 2023 Census. The primary goal of this project is to create a program that collects and presents specific information about a census subject. This information includes the average number of hours that the subject spends with friends per week, the average number of help sessions that the subject attends per semester, and the subject's height in feet and inches, rounded to the nearest inch. The project aims to achieve a user-friendly and efficient solution for gathering and formatting these data points. 
II. Method of Solving the Problem.
The program follows a structured methodology to attain its objectives. It initiates by warmly welcoming the user and elucidating the program's purpose. Subsequently, it prompts the user to input the four requisite numbers: average hours spent with friends, average help sessions attended, feet of height, and inches of height. These data inputs are stored in appropriately declared variables. Finally, the program presents these collected data points in a well-defined format, providing a comprehensible output to the user.
III. Implementation Steps.
The key sections of the program encompass:
- Declaration Section: In which essential variables are declared.
- Greeting Subsection: Where the user is introduced to the program's purpose.
- Input Subsection: Where the user is directed to input the necessary data.
- Output Subsection: Where the program effectively presents the collected data in a neatly formatted manner.
IV. Issues and Problems Addressed During Implementation.
Throughout the implementation of this project, several potential issues and challenges were identified and resolved. These encompassed managing the input of floating-point numbers for average hours and help sessions, ensuring precise formatting for height output (struggling to find where to best put the placeholders), and facilitating smooth user interaction for data input and output.
V. Concepts Learned from this Project.
This project not only addressed the specific problem at hand but also imparted valuable learning experiences. Key concepts acquired include:
- Designing, developing, testing, and debugging C programs.
- Declaring variables with appropriate data types.
- Input and output operations, including user prompts and data presentation.
- Adding new projects to a makefile, aiding in program organization and management.

In conclusion, the primary objective of this project was to create an efficient and user-friendly program for collecting and presenting specific census data. This endeavor was successfully accomplished by adhering to a structured approach, surmounting implementation challenges, and acquiring essential programming concepts. The resulting program serves as a practical tool for streamlining the data collection process for the 2023 Census while providing valuable learning opportunities for software development in the C programming language.
